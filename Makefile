# =============================================================================
# Makefile for the Spirographicals Project
#
# This file provides a high-level command interface for building, testing,
# and managing the project. The complex logic is delegated to the scripts
# located in the ./scripts/ directory.
# =============================================================================

# --- Variables ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Use python3 by default. Can be overridden from the command line.
# e.g., make PYTHON=python3.9 build
PYTHON ?= python3

# Project directories
SCRIPTS_DIR := ./scripts

# --- Phony Targets -----------------------------------------------------------
# Declares targets that are not actual files. This prevents conflicts and
# ensures that the commands will run every time the target is invoked.
.PHONY: all build build-core build-logic package install install-dev test clean help run-example

# --- Primary Targets ---------------------------------------------------------

# The default target, executed when you just run `make`.
all: build

# Builds the entire project from source.
# The dependency chain ensures the C++ core is built before the Rust logic.
build: build-logic
	@echo "‚úÖ Full project build complete."

# Builds only the C++ core library.
build-core:

# This is the recommended command for active development, as it provides
# a fast build-and-test loop without full packaging.

# This simulates how a user would install the published package.
install: package
	@echo "üêç Installing from packaged wheel..."
	@$(PYTHON) -m pip install target/python/wheelhouse/*.whl --force-reinstall

# Runs the complete test suite (C++, Rust, and Python).
# Depends on 'build' to ensure everything is compiled before testing.
test: build
	@echo "üß™ Running full test suite..."
	@$(PYTHON) $(SCRIPTS_DIR)/run_tests.py

# Runs a specific example file to visually verify the build.
# Depends on 'install-dev' to ensure the library is in the current environment.
